The solution involves using strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`). Strict comparison checks for both value and type equality. 

```php
<?php
$value = "10";
if ($value === 10) {
  echo "Values are strictly equal";
} else {
  echo "Values are not strictly equal";
}
?>
```

This revised code will correctly identify that the string "10" is not strictly equal to the integer 10, preventing potential logic errors.
