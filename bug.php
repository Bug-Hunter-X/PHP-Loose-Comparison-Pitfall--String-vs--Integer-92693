This code suffers from a potential issue related to how PHP handles type juggling and comparison.  The `==` operator performs loose comparison, meaning it will perform type coercion before comparison. This can lead to unexpected results when comparing strings and numbers.

```php
<?php
$value = "10";
if ($value == 10) {
  echo "Values are equal";
} else {
  echo "Values are not equal";
}
?>
```

In this example, even though `$value` is a string and `10` is an integer, the loose comparison will evaluate to true because PHP converts the string "10" to an integer before comparing.
